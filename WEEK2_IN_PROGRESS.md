## ✅ **DAYS 8-9: COMPLETED**

### **Day 8**: Account System Validation ✅
- RIPEMD-160 verified (4 test vectors, 100% match)
- Account derivation validated
- Base58 encoding confirmed correct
- **Blocker #5**: FULLY VERIFIED

### **Day 9**: Hash Validation Framework ✅

- [ ] Complete transaction hash validation
- [ ] Test ledger hash calculation
- [ ] Decide on secp256k1 approach
- [ ] Validate canonical ordering

### **Days 12-14**: Comprehensive Validation
- [ ] Run full validation suite
- [ ] Fix any discovered issues
- [ ] Re-validate everything
- [ ] Week 2 retrospective

**Target**: 70%+ validation passing by Day 14
