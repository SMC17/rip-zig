## Week 7 Launch Plan

### Prerequisites (Final Verification)

**Week 5 Tasks** (if not done, do before launch):
- Connect to testnet
- Sync ledgers
- Verify hashes
- Verify signatures
- Stability test

**Week 6 Tasks** (final polish):
- Performance check
- Security review
- Documentation review
- Final testing

### Launch Day (Monday of Week 7)

**8am PT**: Hacker News  
**9am PT**: Twitter  
**10am PT**: Reddit (multiple subs)  
**All day**: Engage community  

### Post-Launch (Week 8+)

**Focus**: Community building and parity maintenance
