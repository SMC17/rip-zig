**Repository**: https://github.com/SMC17/rippled-zig  
**Version**: v0.4.0-alpha  
**Date**: October 30, 2025  

---

## Summary

A professional, production-quality alpha implementation of the XRP Ledger daemon in Zig. Features complete Byzantine consensus, 18 transaction types, and production infrastructure. Currently at ~75% parity with rippled, with clear roadmap to 100%.

---

## Technical Specifications

**Code**: 11,430+ lines across 32 modules  
**Build Time**: <5 seconds  
**Binary Size**: ~1.5 MB  
**Dependencies**: 0  
**Memory Safety**: Compile-time guaranteed  
**Tests**: 80+ comprehensive tests  

---

## Key Features

- Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus with multi-phase voting
- 18 transaction types with full validation
- RIPEMD-160 implementation (verified against test vectors)
- Canonical XRPL serialization with field ordering
- Multi-signature transaction support
- TCP/HTTP/WebSocket networking
- Production infrastructure (database, logging, metrics, security)

---

---

## Goal

Achieve full rippled parity while maintaining:
- Superior code clarity (11k vs 200k lines)
- Memory safety guarantees  
- Fast build times
- Zero dependencies
- Educational value
