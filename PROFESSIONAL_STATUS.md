## Validation Status

### Verified Components

**RIPEMD-160 Implementation**:
- Status: VERIFIED
- Method: Tested against 4 known test vectors
- Results: 100% match
- Confidence: 100%

**Account Address Derivation**:
- Status: VERIFIED  
- Method: Round-trip encoding/decoding tests
- Results: All addresses start with 'r', checksums valid
- Confidence: 100%

**Multi-Signature Support**:
- Status: VERIFIED
- Method: Unit tests for quorum validation
- Results: All tests passing
- Confidence: 95%

**Canonical Field Ordering**:
- Status: IMPLEMENTED and TESTED
- Method: Field sorting verification
- Results: Correct type-based ordering
- Confidence: 90% (needs hash validation against network)

### Components Requiring Further Validation

**Transaction Hash Calculation**:
- Status: Implemented, needs real network validation
- Blocker: Requires Ed25519 transaction from testnet
- Confidence: 75%

**Ledger Hash Calculation**:
- Status: Implemented with merkle trees
- Needs: Validation against real ledger hash
- Confidence: 70%

**secp256k1 Signature Verification**:
- Status: Partial (DER parsing works, ECDSA verification stubbed)
- Note: Most XRPL transactions use secp256k1
- Options: C binding to libsecp256k1 OR document limitation
- Confidence: 60%

## Known Limitations

### Alpha Quality Limitations

**Not Production Ready**:
- No mainnet compatibility testing
- Peer protocol incomplete for full network sync
- secp256k1 verification not fully implemented
- Performance not optimized for high throughput
- Security not professionally audited

**Missing Features**:
- 7 transaction types not yet implemented
- 21 RPC methods not implemented
- Ledger history sync from network
- Amendment system
- Full pathfinding algorithm

**Acceptable Limitations for Alpha**:
- Educational and research quality
- Suitable for learning XRPL protocol
- Good foundation for future development
- Demonstrates Zig systems programming
