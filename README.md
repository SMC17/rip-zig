# rippled-zig

A modern implementation of the XRP Ledger daemon in Zig.

**Status**: Alpha - Educational and research implementation

## Overview

rippled-zig is a ground-up reimplementation of the XRP Ledger protocol in Zig, designed for memory safety, performance, and code clarity. This project demonstrates modern systems programming approaches to blockchain infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Memory Safe**: Compile-time guarantees prevent entire classes of bugs
- **Fast Builds**: Compiles in under 5 seconds (vs 5-10 minutes for C++ rippled)
- **Small Binary**: ~1.5 MB executable (vs 40 MB for C++ rippled)
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Zig standard library only
- **Clean Codebase**: 11,000+ lines vs 200,000+ in C++ implementation

## Implementation Status

**Core Features**:
- Complete Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm
- 18 transaction types with full validation
- TCP/HTTP/WebSocket networking
- Canonical XRPL serialization
- RIPEMD-160 and Base58 address encoding
- Multi-signature transaction support
- Production infrastructure (database, logging, metrics)

**Current Limitations**:
- Alpha quality - not production ready
- secp256k1 signature verification partial
- Peer protocol incomplete
- Not tested on mainnet
- Educational/experimental use only

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Zig 0.15.1 or later

### Build Instructions
