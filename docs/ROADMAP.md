# 🗺️ rippled-zig Roadmap

## Vision

**Become the most advanced, optimized, performant, and secure XRP Ledger implementation** - the go-to integration layer for the XRPL ecosystem, leveraging modern Zig's safety and performance guarantees.

---

## 🎯 Current State (v0.1.0-alpha)

### ✅ What's Complete
- Core type system (XRP, amounts, currencies, accounts)
- Cryptographic primitives (Ed25519, SHA-512 Half)
- Ledger management and state
- Consensus algorithm framework
- Transaction validation and processing
- Build system and comprehensive tests
- Documentation and examples

### 🚧 Current Limitations
- **No network connectivity** - P2P protocol is framework only
- **No RPC server** - API types defined but not implemented
- **Simplified storage** - No database backend integration
- **Incomplete consensus** - Round logic needs full implementation
- **Limited transaction types** - Only basic validation implemented
- **Not production ready** - Educational/experimental stage

### 📊 Project Maturity
- **Code Quality**: 🟢 High (1,408 lines, tested, documented)
- **Feature Completeness**: 🟡 30% (core done, networking/RPC needed)
- **Production Readiness**: 🔴 0% (experimental only)
- **Community**: 🔴 Just starting (0 contributors)
- **Performance**: 🟢 Excellent (fast builds, small binary)
