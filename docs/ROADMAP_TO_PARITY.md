**Remaining**:
- [ ] account_currencies
- [ ] account_lines
- [ ] account_objects
- [ ] account_tx
- [ ] ledger_data
- [ ] ledger_entry
- [ ] tx
- [ ] tx_history
- [ ] sign/sign_for
- [ ] submit_multisigned
- [ ] book_offers
- [ ] deposit_authorized
- [ ] gateway_balances

## Phase 2: Network Integration (Months 2-3)

### Peer Protocol

**Status**: Basic TCP implemented, full protocol needed

**Required**:
- [ ] Complete handshake protocol
- [ ] Peer discovery mechanism
- [ ] Message routing
- [ ] Ledger sync from peers
- [ ] Transaction flooding
- [ ] Peer scoring

**Effort**: 3-4 weeks  
**Priority**: CRITICAL for network operation  

### secp256k1 Support

**Status**: Partial (DER parsing only)

**Required**:
- [ ] Full ECDSA signature verification
- [ ] Public key operations
- [ ] Choose: C binding OR pure Zig

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Priority**: CRITICAL for compatibility  

---

## Phase 3: Validation & Compatibility (Month 4)

### Real Network Testing

- [ ] Testnet sync successful
- [ ] Can process real ledgers
- [ ] Transaction hashing verified
- [ ] State hashing matches network
- [ ] All signatures verify correctly

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  

### Amendment System

- [ ] Amendment voting
- [ ] Feature enablement
- [ ] Protocol upgrades
- [ ] Compatibility tracking

**Effort**: 2 weeks  
**Priority**: HIGH  

---

## Phase 4: Production Hardening (Months 5-6)

### Performance

- [ ] Benchmark against rippled
- [ ] Optimize hot paths
- [ ] SIMD cryptography
- [ ] Concurrent processing
- [ ] Memory optimization

**Effort**: 3-4 weeks  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  

### Security

- [ ] Professional security audit
- [ ] Fuzzing all inputs
- [ ] Attack resistance testing
- [ ] Vulnerability remediation

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: HIGH  

---

## Maintenance Strategy

### Once Parity Achieved

**Main Branch**:
- Tracks rippled releases
- Maintains compatibility
- Security updates
- Bug fixes

**Develop Branch**:
- New features

- Experimental work

**Feature Branches**:
- Specific enhancements
- Research projects
- Optimization attempts

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1: Core Complete
- All 25 transaction types
- All 30+ RPC methods
- Feature parity: 100%

### Phase 2: Network Ready
- Testnet sync working
- Peer protocol complete
- secp256k1 functional

### Phase 3: Validated
- 95%+ compatibility tests passing
- Real network validation
- No critical bugs

### Phase 4: Production Ready
- Security audited
- Performance competitive
- Documentation complete
- Community active

---

## Timeline

```
Month 1-2: Complete remaining features
Month 3-4: Network integration + validation
Month 5-6: Production hardening
Month 6+: Parity maintenance, experimental features
```

**Target**: Full parity by Month 6

## Beyond Parity

### Potential Spin-out Projects

- XRPL client library (pure Zig)
- High-performance RPC server
- XRPL development tools
- Testing and simulation frameworks
- Cross-chain bridges
- Custom XRPL networks

### Innovation Areas

- Advanced monitoring
- Better developer tools
- Performance optimizations
- Novel features (research)
- Educational materials
