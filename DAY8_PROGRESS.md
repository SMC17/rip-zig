# Day 8 Progress: Fixing Critical Blockers

**Date**: October 29-30, 2025  
**Focus**: Clear critical blockers for XRPL compatibility  
**Target**: Fix secp256k1 + canonical ordering  

---

## âœ… **BLOCKERS TO FIX THIS WEEK**

### Priority 1: secp256k1 (Days 8-9)
### Priority 2: Canonical Ordering (Day 10)
### Priority 3: SignerListSet + Multi-sig (Day 11)
### Priority 4: RIPEMD-160 (Day 12)
### Priority 5: Validation (Days 13-14)

---

## ðŸ”¥ **EXECUTION SUMMARY**

### **What We're Building**:

**Target**: XRPL-compatible implementation that can:
- âœ… Verify real secp256k1 signatures from testnet
- âœ… Generate transaction hashes matching network
- âœ… Process multi-signature transactions
- âœ… Derive correct account addresses
- âœ… Pass validation tests against real data

### **Current Progress**:
- Lines: 7,141
- Blockers: 5 identified
- Fixed: Starting now
- Validation: 25% passing

### **By End of Week 2**:
- Lines: 8,000+
- Blockers: 4-5 fixed
- Validation: 60%+ passing
- Status: Compatible with real XRPL

## ðŸ“‹ **NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS**

The work is mapped out. The blockers are clear. The timeline is realistic.

**Now we execute systematically:**

1. Implement secp256k1 (choose pragmatic approach)
2. Fix canonical field ordering
3. Add SignerListSet transaction
4. Implement multi-signature support
5. Add real RIPEMD-160
6. Validate everything against testnet data

**Each fix gets:**
- Implementation
- Tests
- Validation against real data
- Documentation
- Commit

**Timeline**: 5-7 focused days to clear all blockers

## ðŸŽ¯ **THE GOAL**

By end of Week 2: **Real XRPL compatibility verified**

By end of Week 3: **90%+ tests passing**

By end of Week 4: **Production-quality alpha**

Week 5: **LAUNCH with confidence**

**Status**: Week 2 execution begins  
**Focus**: Fix blockers, verify compatibility  
**Standard**: No shortcuts, just correctness  

**Let's make this ACTUALLY work with real XRPL.** ðŸ”¥
