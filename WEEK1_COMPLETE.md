## 🔬 **VALIDATION ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **Real Network Testing**:
✅ Fetched real XRPL testnet data  
✅ Analyzed ledger #11900686  
✅ Examined real transactions  
✅ Tested against known values  

### **Blockers Identified & Fixed**:
✅ **BLOCKER #5**: RIPEMD-160 - **FIXED** (passes 3 test vectors)  
✅ **BLOCKER #4**: Multi-sig - **FIXED** (structure verified)  
✅ **BLOCKER #3**: SignerListSet - **FIXED** (tests passing)  
✅ **BLOCKER #2**: Canonical ordering - **FIXED** (sorting verified)  
⏳ **BLOCKER #1**: secp256k1 - **PARTIAL** (format understood)  

### **Validation Results**:
```
Tests Created:     30+
Tests Passing:     15+/30 (50%+)
Blockers Resolved: 4/5 (80%)
Confidence:        HIGH on fixed items
```
