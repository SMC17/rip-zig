## CRITICAL PATH TO PARITY

### Phase 1: Complete Transaction Types (Week 1)

**Implement 7 remaining transaction types**:

1. NFTokenCancelOffer (~100 lines)
2. NFTokenAcceptOffer (~150 lines)
3. AccountDelete (~200 lines)
4. SetRegularKey (~100 lines)
5. DepositPreauth (~150 lines)
6. Clawback (~200 lines)
7. TicketCreate (~100 lines)

**Total**: ~1,000 lines  
**Time**: 5-7 days  

### Phase 2: Complete RPC Methods (Weeks 2-3)

**Implement 21 remaining RPC methods**:

Account methods (~300 lines each): 1,500 lines  
Ledger methods (~200 lines each): 600 lines  
Transaction methods (~200 lines each): 800 lines  
Path/Book methods (~250 lines each): 1,000 lines  
Server methods (~150 lines each): 450 lines  

**Total**: ~4,350 lines  
**Time**: 10-14 days  

### Phase 3: secp256k1 Implementation (Week 4)

**Options**:
1. C binding to libsecp256k1: 2-3 days
2. Pure Zig implementation: 7-10 days

**Recommendation**: C binding for speed

**Total**: ~500 lines  
**Time**: 2-3 days  

### Phase 4: Complete Peer Protocol (Week 5)

**Implement**:
- Peer handshake protocol
- Ledger sync mechanism
- Transaction flooding
- Peer management

**Total**: ~800 lines  
**Time**: 5-7 days  

### Phase 5: Amendment System (Week 6)

**Implement**:
- Amendment voting
- Feature flags
- Protocol versioning

**Total**: ~400 lines  
**Time**: 2-3 days  

---

## TOTAL ESTIMATE

**Lines to Add**: ~7,050 lines  
**Current**: 11,430 lines  
**Target**: ~18,500 lines  
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks of focused work  

---

## EXECUTION PLAN

### Weeks 1-2: Transaction Types + RPC (Phase 1-2)
- Implement all 7 transaction types
- Implement 10 highest-priority RPC methods
- Target: 25/25 transactions, 19/30 RPC

### Weeks 3-4: Complete RPC + secp256k1 (Phase 2-3)
- Implement remaining 11 RPC methods
- Complete secp256k1
- Target: 30/30 RPC, secp256k1 working

### Weeks 5-6: Peer Protocol + Amendments (Phase 4-5)
- Complete peer protocol
- Implement amendment system
- Target: Full network compatibility

### Weeks 7-8: Validation + Hardening
- Comprehensive testing against testnet
- Fix all discovered issues
- Security review
- Performance optimization

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Before Launch**:
- [x] All 25 transaction types implemented
- [x] All 30+ RPC methods working
- [x] secp256k1 fully functional
- [x] Can sync from testnet
- [x] Amendment system working
- [x] 95%+ tests passing
- [x] Security reviewed
- [x] Documentation complete

**ONLY THEN**: Launch to community

---

**This is the right approach - ship something COMPLETE, not incremental.**

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks to 100% parity  
**Then**: Launch as robust, complete implementation  
**Community joins**: For hardening and innovation, not basic features
