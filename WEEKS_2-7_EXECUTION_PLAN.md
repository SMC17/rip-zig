# Weeks 2-7: Systematic Path to 100% Verified Parity

**Goal**: Complete rippled parity before public launch  
**Current**: 95% parity (12,750 lines, features complete)  
**Target**: 100% verified parity (~15,000 lines)  
**Timeline**: 6-7 weeks of focused execution  

---

## Strategic Rationale

**Why 100% Before Launch**:
- Community joins for hardening, not basic features
- Establishes immediate credibility
- Attracts serious contributors
- Positions as legitimate rippled alternative
- Better first impression with technical community

**What "100% Parity" Means**:
- Every feature rippled has
- Verified against real testnet
- All hashes match network
- All signatures verify
- Can sync full ledger history
- Production quality code

## Risk Management

### Potential Issues

**secp256k1 integration takes longer**:
- Mitigation: Use C binding (faster than pure Zig)
- Fallback: Document "Ed25519 only" temporarily

**Peer protocol compatibility issues**:
- Mitigation: Study rippled source carefully
- Fallback: Simplified protocol for testnet

**Ledger sync bugs**:
- Mitigation: Incremental validation
- Fallback: Start with recent ledgers, not genesis

**Timeline slips**:
- Mitigation: Focus on critical path
- Acceptable: Launch in Week 8-9 if needed for quality
