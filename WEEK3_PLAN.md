## ðŸ“… WEEK 3 BREAKDOWN

### **Days 15-16: RPC Format Matching**

**Goal**: Ensure all RPC responses match real rippled format

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fetch real rippled RPC responses for all 9 implemented methods
- [ ] Compare our responses with real responses
- [ ] Identify format mismatches
- [ ] Fix field names, types, and structures
- [ ] Add missing fields (network_id, server_state, etc.)
- [ ] Validate responses match exactly

**Deliverables**:
- All 9 RPC methods match rippled format
- Format validation tests created
- Documentation updated

---

### **Days 17-18: Performance Testing**

**Goal**: Benchmark and optimize hot paths

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Stress test consensus rounds (100+ rounds)
- [ ] Load test RPC server (100+ concurrent requests)
- [ ] Memory profiling (find leaks, optimize allocations)
- [ ] Optimize hot paths (hash calculations, serialization)
- [ ] Benchmark against targets
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

**Deliverables**:
- Performance benchmarks documented
- Hot paths optimized
- Memory usage optimized
- Performance tests created

### **Days 19-20: Remaining Features**

**Goal**: Complete missing transaction types and RPC methods

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add remaining transaction types:
  - [ ] NFTokenCancelOffer, NFTokenAcceptOffer
  - [ ] AccountDelete, SetRegularKey
  - [ ] DepositPreauth, Clawback
- [ ] Complete peer protocol basics:
  - [ ] Full handshake implementation
  - [ ] Message protocol completion
- [ ] Finish remaining RPC methods:
  - [ ] account_currencies, account_lines, account_objects
  - [ ] ledger_data, ledger_entry, tx, tx_history
  - [ ] book_offers, path_find
- [ ] Integration testing

**Deliverables**:
- All 25 transaction types implemented
- Basic peer protocol working
- 20+ RPC methods implemented
- Integration tests passing

---

### **Day 21: Week 3 Review**

**Goal**: Review progress, validate achievements

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Run full validation suite (target: 90%+)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks review
- [ ] Security review checklist
- [ ] Week 3 retrospective
- [ ] Plan Week 4

**Deliverables**:
- 90%+ validation passing
- Performance benchmarks
- Security review complete
- Week 3 retrospective
- Week 4 plan ready
