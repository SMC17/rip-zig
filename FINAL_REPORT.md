## 📖 Code Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Payment

```zig
// Generate keys
var sender_keys = try crypto.KeyPair.generateEd25519(allocator);
var receiver_keys = try crypto.KeyPair.generateEd25519(allocator);

// Create payment of 100 XRP
const payment = transaction.PaymentTransaction.create(
    sender_keys.getAccountID(),
    receiver_keys.getAccountID(),
    types.Amount.fromXRP(100 * types.XRP),
    types.MIN_TX_FEE,
    1, // sequence
    sender_keys.public_key[0..33].*,
);

// Sign and submit
try payment.sign(sender_keys, allocator);
try processor.submitTransaction(payment.base);
```

### Example 2: Running Consensus

```zig
// Initialize ledger and consensus
var ledger_manager = try ledger.LedgerManager.init(allocator);
var consensus_engine = try consensus.ConsensusEngine.init(allocator);

// Add validators
try consensus_engine.addValidator(validator_info);

// Run consensus round
try consensus_engine.startRound();
const new_ledger = try ledger_manager.closeLedger(transactions);
const result = try consensus_engine.finalizeRound();
```
