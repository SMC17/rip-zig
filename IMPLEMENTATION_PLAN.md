- [ ] Memory leak free
- [ ] No known crashes
- [ ] Clean code review

### Documentation

- [ ] Can process real transactions
- [ ] Can participate in consensus
- [ ] Stable for 24+ hours

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Consensus complexity** - Most complex component
   - Mitigation: Break into small pieces, test incrementally

2. **Database performance** - Could be bottleneck
   - Mitigation: Start with simple solution, optimize later

3. **Time estimate** - Might take longer
   - Mitigation: Focus on core features first, defer nice-to-haves

### Decision Points

**Week 2 Checkpoint**: 
- If consensus not working, simplify approach
- If behind schedule, defer non-critical features

**Week 4 Checkpoint**:
- Assess launch readiness
- Decide if need more time
- Identify critical path items
